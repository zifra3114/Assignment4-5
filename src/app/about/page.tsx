      <p>Hi, I&apos;m Zifra Firdous, a passionate web developer with a keen interest in creating visually appealing, responsive, and functional websites. I specialize in using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and Next.js to bring ideas to life on the web.

I enjoy tackling challenges, whether it&apos;s designing user-friendly interfaces, improving performance, or debugging complex issues. My goal is to continuously learn, explore new tools, and enhance my skills to deliver the best results for the projects I work on.

Beyond web development, I am also exploring artificial intelligence and have a background in medical studies. These fields fuel my curiosity and keep me motivated to innovate and grow</p>
